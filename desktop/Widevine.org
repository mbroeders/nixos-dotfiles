#+title: Widevine

* Background

Taken from =arch aur= I've downloaded the official =Google-Chrome-Stable= browser .deb package and extracted it using =ar -x file=. Might not be totally up-to-date, but working for me to get Netflix to work in qutebrowser.

* Installation
- Copy the chromium* folders to /usr/lib

  #+begin_src

sudo mkdir -pv /usr/lib
sudo cp -rv {chromium,chromium-dev} /usr/lib/

  #+end_src

- Check the symlinks

  Make sure =/usr/lib/chromium/libwidevinecdm.so= points to the correct location, i.e. =/usr/lib/chromium/WidevineCdm/_platform_specific/linux_x64/libwidevinecdm.so=
